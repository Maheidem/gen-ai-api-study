      "🦜 Captain: Ahoy there, matey! Great question ye scurvy dog!\n",
      "\n",
      "Ocean waves be caused by a few mighty forces, arr!\n",
      "\n",
      "First and foremost, the wind be the main culprit, ye hear? When wind blows across the water's surface, it creates friction and pushes the water along. The bigger the wind and the longer it blows, the bigger the waves get, arr!\n",
      "\n",
      "Storms and weather systems also create massive waves, especially when they're really fierce and violent. And don't ye forget about the mighty tides - the gravitational pull of the moon and sun creates those enormous swells, matey!\n",
      "\n",
      "Even earthquakes and volcanic eruptions down below can send tsunami waves crashing onto shores, though those be quite rare and dangerous.\n",
      "\n",
      "So ye see, the ocean's never truly still, matey. There's always some force moving the water around, creating those magnificent waves that we pirates love to sail upon!\n",

      "🏴‍☠️ Question: Tell me about dolphins.\n",
      "🦜 Captain: Ahoy there, matey! Ye want to know about dolphins? Well, arr, they be fascinating creatures of the deep! \n",
      "\n",
      "Dolphins be highly intelligent marine mammals that live in pods, just like we pirates stick together on our ships! They be known for their playful nature and incredible echolocation abilities - kind of like how we use our compasses and charts to navigate the seas, but they use sound waves to \"see\" in the water!\n",
      "\n",
      "These magnificent creatures can leap high out of the water, which be called breaching, and they be excellent swimmers, reaching speeds up to 37 miles per hour! They be social animals that communicate with each other through clicks, whistles, and body language.\n",
      "\n",
      "Arr, dolphins be also known for their curiosity and sometimes approach ships, much like how we might approach a new island! They be gentle giants of the ocean, though they do have sharp teeth - but don't ye worry, they be more interested in fish than in pirate ships!\n",

      "\n",
      "'Tis the Mariana Trench, ye scallywag! Located in the western Pacific Ocean, this underwater canyon plunges to an incredible depth of about 36,000 feet - that's roughly 7 miles down to the bottom! \n",
      "\n",
      "The deepest spot within the Mariana Trench is called Challenger Deep, and it's so deep that if ye were to drop a coin from the surface, it would take nearly an hour to reach the bottom! \n",
      "\n",
      "Arr, the pressure down there is so intense that ye'd be crushed like a tin can, matey! The water pressure at the bottom is over 1,000 times greater than at the surface. \n",
      "\n",
      "But don't ye worry - we pirates know that the ocean holds many secrets, and even the deepest trenches have their own unique creatures that have adapted to survive in those dark, crushing depths! \n",
      "\n",
      "Ahoy, matey, keep yer head above water and yer eyes on the horizon! 🏴‍☠️🌊\n",

    "## ⚠️ Common Pitfalls\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Temperature Too High for Factual Tasks\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# ❌ Bad: High temperature for math\n",
    "answer = client.chat(\"What is 127 * 893?\", temperature=1.8)\n",
    "# May give wrong or inconsistent answers\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "### 2. System Prompt Conflicts\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# ❌ Bad: Conflicting instructions\n",
    "response = client.chat(\n",
    "    \"Be creative and give me 5 wild ideas!\",\n",
    "    system=\"You are a conservative, by-the-book assistant. Always be brief.\",\n",

    "### 3. Ignoring Token Limits\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# ❌ Bad: Asking for long response without setting max_tokens\n",
    "response = client.chat(\"Write a complete essay about AI ethics.\")\n",

    "# ✅ Good: Set appropriate token limit\n",

    "    max_tokens=1000\n",
    ")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Not Testing Temperature Settings\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# ✅ Good: Test different temperatures to find what works\n",
