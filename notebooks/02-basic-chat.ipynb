      "And here’s a more complex example demonstrating a few features:\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "# Define a function\n",
      "def greet(name):\n",
      "    return f\"Hello, {name}!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "# Use the function\n",
      "user = input(\"Enter your name: \")\n",
      "print(greet(user))\n",
      "\n",
      "# List comprehension\n",
      "numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
      "squared = [x**2 for x in numbers]\n",

      "\n",
      "1. **First, open the toy box**: This means you need to understand what AI is. It's like teaching a robot to be smart, just like you! It can learn from things around it and make decisions. For example, when you teach your dog to sit, that's a tiny bit of AI.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Next, find some simple toys inside the box**: Start with easy concepts:\n",
      "   - **Algorithms**: Imagine they're like recipes. You follow them step by step to make something, like cooking a yummy cake.\n",
      "   - **Data**: This is like all the ingredients in your kitchen. AI learns from data, so it needs lots of good stuff to play with.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Now, let's play with some toys**:\n",
      "   - **Machine Learning (ML)**: Think of this as teaching your friend to guess what you're holding. If you show them many apples, they'll learn that red and round is an apple!\n",
      "     - Start with something called *supervised learning*. It's like when mom tells you if your drawing is good or needs more work.\n",
      "   - **Deep Learning**: This is like teaching your friend to guess what you're holding, but now they can look at lots of things at once. Like, if it's red and round and has a stem, it's probably an apple.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Now, let's make our own toys**:\n",
      "   - Start with simple projects! Maybe teach AI to recognize cats or dogs in pictures. It's like teaching your friend to guess which is which from lots of photos.\n",
      "   - Use fun tools like:\n",
      "     - Scratch: It's like building with LEGO blocks. There are special AI blocks for you to try!\n",
      "     - Google's Teachable Machine: You can teach it to recognize things, just like in the cat/dog example.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Finally, keep playing and learning more**:\n",
      "   - Try harder toys as you get better.\n",
      "   - Ask for help from friends or grown-ups who know more about AI.\n",
      "   - Watch fun videos and read easy books about AI.\n",
      "\n",
      "And remember, it's okay if you don't understand everything right away. Even the smartest AI learners need time to play and figure things out! Just keep having fun with that magical toy box called AI. 🎮🤖💫\n"

      "🏴‍☠️ Question: What causes ocean waves?\n",
      "🦜 Captain: Ahoy there, matey! Ye be askin’ a grand question, ye are. The mighty ocean waves, they be the result o’ many factors, savvy?\n",
      "\n",
      "First off, wind be the main culprit, it is. When the breeze blows across the sea’s surface, friction causes the water to pile up and create little ripples, which grow bigger as the wind keeps a-blownin’. The stronger the wind, the larger the waves, aye!\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, sometimes, when storms roll in from far away, they can send big waves our way, even days later. These be called swells, they are.\n",
      "\n",
      "But that ain’t all! Earthquakes under the sea or landslides into the water can cause mighty tsunamis too, they can. Though those be less common, savvy?\n",
      "\n",
      "So, in summary, matey: wind, storms, and sometimes even quakes below the sea cause the waves to rise and fall as they do.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fair winds to ye, and may yer journey across the vast blue be filled with wonder!\n",
      "======================================================================\n",
      "\n",
      "🏴‍☠️ Question: Tell me about dolphins.\n",
      "🦜 Captain: Ahoy there, matey! Ye be askin' about one of the finest creatures of the sea, the dolphins! Arr!\n",
      "\n",
      "First off, let me tell ye that dolphins be intelligent, social beasts, often found dancin' and playin' in the waves. They be part of a group called cetaceans, which also includes whales and porpoises.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, there be about 40 different species of dolphins, each one more remarkable than the last! Some be large like the orca, which we sometimes call killer whales (but don't ye worry, they won't be botherin' us on our voyage), while others be smaller, like the common dolphin.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dolphins be known for their exceptional intelligence. They communicate with each other using clicks and whistles, almost like their own secret language! Some even have names for themselves that they use to call to each other across vast distances of ocean!\n",
      "\n",
      "What's more, these clever sea beasts use tools! The bottlenose dolphin, for instance, uses sponges to protect its snout while searchin' the seafloor for food.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dolphins also be known for their playful nature. Ye might see them ridin' waves, leapin' out of the water, or even bow-ridin', where they surf on a boat's wake!\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, matey, one of the most amazing things about dolphins be that they help humans! In many places, fishermen work with dolphins to catch fish. The dolphins herd the fish towards the shore, and once the catch is made, the fishermen share some of their bounty with their finned friends.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, there ye have it! Dolphins – smart, playful, helpful creatures of the sea. Savvy?\n",
      "======================================================================\n",
      "\n",
      "🏴‍☠️ Question: What's the deepest part of the ocean?\n",
      "🦜 Captain: Ahoy there, me hearty! The deepest part o' the ocean be the Mariana Trench. Arr! It's a massive, crescent-shaped dip in the seafloor near the Mariana Islands. The lowest point be called the Challenger Deep, me bucko. Now, listen close, fer this is a mighty impressive number: it goes down 'bout 36,070 feet (10,994 meters), that's more than a thousand feet deeper than Mount Everest be tall! Ye could place the whole Empire State Buildin', me heartie, and still have over a mile o' water above it!\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, this here trench is home to some strange and wonderful creatures, adapted to livin' in the cold, dark, and high-pressure depths. We've got creatures like the snailfish and amphipods, plus some yet undiscovered beasts, savvy? It's a treasure trove o' mysteries, just waitin' fer brave souls with submersibles to explore it further! Shiver me timbers, the deep sea never fails to amaze!\n",

    "## ⚠️ Common Pitfalls\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Temperature Too High for Factual Tasks\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# ❌ Bad: High temperature for math\n",
    "answer = client.chat(\"What is 127 * 893?\", temperature=1.8)\n",
    "# May give wrong or inconsistent answers\n",
    "\n",
    "# ✅ Good: Low temperature for facts\n",
    "answer = client.chat(\"What is 127 * 893?\", temperature=0.1)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. System Prompt Conflicts\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# ❌ Bad: Conflicting instructions\n",
    "response = client.chat(\n",
    "    \"Be creative and give me 5 wild ideas!\",\n",
    "    system=\"You are a conservative, by-the-book assistant. Always be brief.\",\n",
    "    temperature=1.5\n",
    ")\n",
    "\n",
    "# ✅ Good: Aligned instructions\n",
    "response = client.chat(\n",
    "    \"Give me 5 creative ideas for a tech startup!\",\n",
    "    system=\"You are a creative entrepreneur who thinks outside the box.\",\n",
    "    temperature=1.2\n",
    ")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Ignoring Token Limits\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# ❌ Bad: Asking for long response without setting max_tokens\n",
    "response = client.chat(\"Write a complete essay about AI ethics.\")\n",
    "# May get cut off mid-sentence\n",
    "\n",
    "# ✅ Good: Set appropriate token limit\n",
    "response = client.chat(\n",
    "    \"Write a complete essay about AI ethics.\",\n",
    "    max_tokens=1000\n",
    ")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Not Testing Temperature Settings\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# ✅ Good: Test different temperatures to find what works\n",
    "for temp in [0.3, 0.7, 1.2]:\n",
    "    response = client.chat(\"Write a product tagline.\", temperature=temp)\n",
