      "3. **Practice, practice, practice!** Like swabbin' the deck, ye need to keep at it. Try writin' small programs, like calculators or simple games.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Join a crew**: Look fer online communities where ye can ask questions and learn from other pirates - er, coders. The Python subreddit and Stack Overflow be great places to start.\n",

      "A: [THINK]Alright, I remember that France is a country in Europe. What's its capital? Is it Paris? Yes, I think Paris is the capital of France.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, to confirm this, let me double-check some facts. The Eiffel Tower is in Paris, and it's often associated with being the capital. Also, historically, Paris has been the political center of France.\n",

      "Okay, so my response should be that the capital of France is Paris.[/THINK]The capital of France is Paris.\n",
      "\n",
      "Q: What's the population?\n",
      "A: [THINK]Now, what about the population of Paris? I remember that it's a large city, but I'm not sure of the exact number. Maybe around 2 million? But that seems low for such a big city.\n",
      "\n",
      "I recall that the population of Paris itself (within the city limits) is different from the metropolitan area. The city proper might be about 2 million, while the metro area is much larger, maybe around 10-12 million?\n",
      "\n",
      "But to be precise, I need to recall or estimate the most recent figure. As of my last update in October 2023, the population of Paris was approximately 2.1 million within city limits and about 11 million in the metropolitan area.\n",
      "\n",
      "For this question, if it's asking about the city proper, I'll provide that number.[/THINK]The population of Paris is approximately 2.1 million people (within city limits). The metropolitan area has a much larger population, around 11-12 million.\n",
      "\n",
      "Q: Name 3 famous landmarks\n",
      "A: [THINK]Okay, France has many famous landmarks. Let me think of three.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, the Eiffel Tower in Paris is probably the most famous. It's an iconic iron tower that was built for the 1889 World's Fair.\n",
      "\n",
      "Second, the Louvre Museum in Paris is also very famous. It houses thousands of works of art, including the Mona Lisa.\n",
      "\n",
      "Third, how about the Palace of Versailles? It's a grand royal château that was the seat of political power in France under King Louis XIV.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, three famous landmarks could be:\n",
      "1. Eiffel Tower\n",
      "2. Louvre Museum\n",
      "3. Palace of Versailles\n",
      "\n",
      "But just to make sure, are there others that might be more famous? Maybe Notre-Dame Cathedral is also very well-known, as it's an important religious and cultural landmark in Paris.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me stick with the first three I thought of for simplicity.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, to present them clearly:\n",

      "1. Eiffel Tower\n",

    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrated the key features of `local_llm_sdk`:\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ What We Covered:\n",
    "1. **Client Setup** - Simple initialization with base URL and model\n",
    "2. **List Models** - Get available models from the server\n",
    "3. **Simple Chat** - Just pass a string for quick responses\n",
    "4. **System Prompts** - Control the assistant's behavior\n",
    "5. **Conversation History** - Maintain context across messages\n",
    "6. **Full Responses** - Access metadata like token usage\n",
    "7. **Embeddings** - Generate vectors for semantic search\n",
    "8. **Temperature Control** - Adjust creativity/determinism\n",
    "9. **Error Handling** - Graceful error management\n",
    "10. **Quick Chat** - One-off queries without client setup\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🎯 Key Benefits:\n",
    "- **Simple API** - Intuitive methods for common tasks\n",
    "- **Type Safety** - Pydantic models for all responses\n",
    "- **Flexible** - Works with any OpenAI-compatible server\n",
    "- **Production Ready** - Error handling and validation built-in\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📚 Next Steps:\n",
    "- Check out `tool-use-simplified.ipynb` for function calling examples\n",
    "- Read the package documentation in the README\n",
    "- Try different models and compare their capabilities\n",
    "- Build your own applications with the SDK!"
