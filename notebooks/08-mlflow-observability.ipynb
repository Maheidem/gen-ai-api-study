    "## 1️⃣ What is MLflow Tracing?\n",
    "\n",
    "**MLflow** is an open-source platform for managing ML workflows. **Tracing** is a feature that records the execution of your LLM applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Tracing?\n",
    "\n",
    "Without tracing:\n",
    "- ❌ Can't see what the agent did internally\n",
    "- ❌ Hard to debug when things go wrong\n",
    "- ❌ No visibility into performance bottlenecks\n",
    "- ❌ Difficult to optimize complex workflows\n",
    "\n",
    "With tracing:\n",
    "- ✅ See every LLM call, tool execution, and decision\n",
    "- ✅ Visualize hierarchical execution flow\n",
    "- ✅ Measure timing for each component\n",
    "- ✅ Debug issues by inspecting inputs/outputs at each step\n",
    "- ✅ Compare different runs side-by-side\n",

    "# No traces will be generated\n",

    "# Then open http://localhost:5000\n",
    "```\n",

    "### 3. Overwhelming Trace Volume\n",

    "### 4. Not Using Experiments\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# ❌ Bad: All traces in default experiment\n",
    "client.chat(\"Task 1\")\n",
    "client.chat(\"Task 2\")\n",

    "\n",
    "# Look for:\n",
    "# - Slow operations (optimize or cache)\n",
